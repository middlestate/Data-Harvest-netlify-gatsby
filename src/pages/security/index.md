project_description_p1: Security is a thread that pulls through all of DataHarvests solutions. Security was one of the first reasons we invested into a whole farm network. The ability to add sensors and cameras to the same network allows them to work in tandem.  Building physical security solutions as flexible and wide ranging as each farm.
project_description_p2: Security is just as important when produce leaves the farm. We have partnered with the best portable environmental sensor company on the planet, Most.  Most builds a modern sensor solution for the modern world. Fully wireless it requires less time and has fewer humans involved in collecting data when produce is on the move.
project_description_p3: Lastly, our blockchain is building a secure history that traces back to the development of produce.  Food fraud is estimated to be a $10-$15 billion drag on the food system.  Data security can combat fraud and deliver better product at better prices to consumers by squeezing out the fraudsters.
