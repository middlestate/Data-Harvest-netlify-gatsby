spotlight_subheading: Answering the question of ‘how?’ blockchain in the food system
spotlight_description: >-
  We are telling the story of the producers and the products.  Capturing the
  story of the product told by the people that make it.  Attaching that story to
  the product and allowing people to add to the richness of that story. 
  DataHarvest, along with our partners have developed a smart label that
  uniquely pairs blockchain with the foodchain.  Our open and ground up approach
  provided an important option for those looking to use blockchains in their
  business.
