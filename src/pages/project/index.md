title: DataHarvest Project
lifecycle_title: A connected view of the produce lifecycle at each stage of the product lifecycle
lifecycle_description: DataHarvestâ€™s vision for the future farm is about end-to-end knowledge. Our FirstBlock Ledger is a modular platform for building, deploying, and running distributed ledgers. Distributed ledgers provide a digital record, like asset ownership, that is maintained without a central authority or implementation. This provides unparalleled transparency and security; that provides value to all parties.
